				<h3> Introduction ùúóùúö </h3>
				<p> Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10) is focused on reducing inequality both within countries and among different nations. Inequality affects various aspects of life, from income and wealth to access to opportunities. SDG 10 aims to address these disparities to ensure that everyone has a fair chance at a better life. </p>

                <p>Around the world, there's a big gap between the rich and the poor. The top 10% of earners have up to 52% of the world‚Äôs income, while the bottom 10% have only about 2%. This shows how unevenly money is distributed and why it's important to address these disparities. 
				In the Philippines, income inequality is also a problem. The Gini coefficient, which measures how income is spread out among people, is around 0.42. This means there's a significant difference between the incomes of the wealthiest and the poorest people. Reducing this gap is essential for improving fairness and living standards in the country.</p>

				<h2>Importance of Reducing Inequality</h2>

            <div class="text-content">
                <p>Cutting down inequality helps make society fairer and more stable. When wealth and opportunities are shared more evenly, it boosts social harmony and economic health. People are better able to access education, healthcare, and other vital services, which helps break the cycle of poverty and increases chances for everyone. 

				When we reduce inequality, it not only improves individual lives but also benefits society as a whole. It leads to less crime, better economic performance, and stronger communities. Working towards a fairer world helps ensure everyone has a chance to succeed and contributes to long-term growth and stability.</p>

            <div class="text-content">
                <p>You can help fight inequality by learning more about it and sharing what you know with others. Support groups and programs that work to reduce these gaps and push for changes that make opportunities more equal for everyone.
				
				Every action, no matter how small, contributes to the larger goal of creating a more equitable world. By taking steps to address inequality in your own community and supporting global efforts, you are helping to build a fairer, more inclusive society for everyone.</p>
